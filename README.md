# Annotated Wavenet

The purpose of this repository and the corresponding paper, annotated_wavenet.pdf, is to annotate and explain
DeepMindâ€™s WaveNet architecture. The module is divided into several submodules that collate data, define the 
models parts and then train and generate. This implentation is based on the version available here:
https://github.com/ryujaehun/wavenet
    
The model is capable of identifying and imitating the rhythmic features of the seed file and not much more. With
more computational power and a larger receptive field, it could be expanded to creating samples like those found
in DeepMind's blog post here:
